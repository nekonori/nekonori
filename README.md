# Laboratory Coursework Repositories

The repositories in this GitHub profile contain the code that I write during my laboratory coursework at Anna University. The repository is intended to serve as a reference for myself and my fellow students.

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific laboratory course or project, and contains the code files and any relevant documentation for that course. The code is written in a variety of programming languages used in the coursework and is intended to demonstrate the concepts covered in each laboratory course.

Please note that this code is intended to be used as a reference only, and should not be copied or submitted as your own work. It is your responsibility to ensure that you understand the material and can complete the assignments on your own.

Feel free to browse the repository, download the code, and use it as a reference for your own work. If you find any errors or have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and good luck with your laboratory coursework!
